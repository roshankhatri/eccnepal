<h4 class="ui justified">Nepal, being a developing country, is facing many problems in its education system. Nepali children are not receiving the education they deserve from government-funded school.</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, in a country where 30% of the population is below poverty, private education is not available to most children. Children receiving private education begin learning in an English medium from Grade 1. In community schools, children are not learning English until later on and it is causing them to fall behind. Even more pressing are the conditions which many of these children are attending school under. Many schools do not offer adequate facilities such as toilets, drinking water, books and shelter from harsh winters.</p>

<p>The goal of Education Concern Center, Nepal (ECC) is to improve these situations by providing assistance to rural schools on a number of different levels. Financially, ECC assists in funding building costs and teachers’ salaries. We also contribute supplies to better the learning process, such as books, book bags and water bottles. Also, by holding training sessions for teachers and providing volunteers to teach English, ECC is helping community schoolchildren catch up to their private school peers. The ECC believes that every child has a right to a proper education, whether they are rich, poor, urban or rural.</p>
