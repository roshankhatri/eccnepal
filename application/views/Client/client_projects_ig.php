			<h4>Background</h4>
			<p>The education is worse in most of community schools in Nepal. Therefore, private schools are being good opportunity for earning in city areas in Nepal. Government of Nepal is not being able to implement a Free and Compulsory education in primary level. It is just putting more money and supporting in different aspect of school education. There are many reasons and excuses   to be poor education quality in schools. Among them the poverty is main and then the level of awareness, unstable government and many others. </p>
			<p>Krishna Primary School is a representative school of community school in Nepal. The infrastructure of school was very poor but now it is good because Mr. Garry is supporting from the beginning of 2007. We started Friday celebration program, teacher training, workshops for management committee, library support and some supplies. Regularity of students is increasing, teachers are punctual and dedicated but the quality of education is still poor in that school. After analyzing the situation of the school; disadvantaged community (Dalits - untouchable caste) and poor parents are not able to give their attention to their child's education and they cannot involve in activities organized by the school. So the income generation program for these parents keeps important role in improving the quality of education a following.</p>
			<h4>Objectives</h4>
			<p>Following are major objectives of the IGP</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To create source of income in disadvantaged and pro poor families in school community</li>
				<li>To increase regularity of students from disadvantaged and pro poor families</li>
				<li>To reduce drop out and repetition rate in school</li>
				<li>To increase promotion rate and achievement level in all grades</li>
				<li>To develop school as a common and important institution of the community</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Methodology</h4>
			<p>School has a limited amount of budget in a bank account. Executive committee will be formed to handle the program and principal and ECC representative are compulsory in the committee. This committee is responsible to developing guideline and follows the annual plan. Pro poor families' particular school parents have right to be benefited by the program. The whole parent will be member of this IG program and they will nominate an executive body where school principal and ECC representative are compulsory member of the committee. Executive committee organize orientation program for all parent members and then parents will apply for mini grant to start their small projects like; goat keeping; vegetable farm, cash crops, poultry farms and others. For example; parents buy 10/20 local chickens, grow and then sell them and finally reimbursement the loan. However, their poultry farm will be continuing with some chickens. Turmeric (a kind of species), Zinger and Timur ( a kind of hot species like black pepper) can be grown and collection and then they can sell within six month. So that this loan facility will be for six to eight month, period and then they will return. It will have some limitations like; maximum amount of loan is Rs. 5,000.00 ($58.80 @85 or may be $60.00 in round figure) and 15 parents can be benefited at a time in which 3 parents from each grade. However, sometime there may be 4 parents from a grade if there is only two parents from any other grade.  A fixed agreement form will be developed with time limit and will be followed by all members. A person who is not a member and parent of the school will not get the loan facility. There is another condition that parent should attend activities organized by the school and visit school in every meeting. In addition, parents will pay minimum interest (may be 10%, committee will decide) when they return the loan.       </p>
			<h4>Amount</h4>
			<p>Total amount of IGP fund will be Rs. 100,000.00 ($1176.47 @85) in the beginning.</p>
			<h4>Transition</h4>
			<p>There is bank in half an hour walking distance (going to open within 4/5 months). Therefore, the committee will issue cheques for parents who are going to have loan and parents will deposit according to agreement and submit the bank receipt to the school.</p>
			<h4>Activities:</h4>
			<p>Following activities will be prioritized</p>		
			<ol>
				<li>Vegetable garden</li>
				<li>Poultry farming</li>
				<li>Cash crops - Zinger, Turmeric, Timur, and others</li>
				<li>Small business - in the winter session; buy orange today and sell tomorrow in the nearest market and others</li>
				<li>Goat keeping</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>Beneficiary group: </h4>
			<p>Parents of the Krishna Primary School are target group particularly parents from disadvantaged community are in priority. </p>
			<h4>Monitoring:</h4>
			<p>School Management Committee (SMC) members and ECC members will attend the executive committee meeting and then they will check all transition reports. </p>
			<h4>Sustainability: </h4>
			<p>The initial fund is refundable and it never loses. Parents borrow for 6-8 months and then they deposit. The same process follows for all years until parents are able to start their regular business or income generation program. After 5/6 years, most of the parents will be able to start their own business or they can continue their earlier businesses like vegetable garden, poultry farming, goat keeping and others and then we can start another project with this fund.  </p>
