<p>Everything the ECC does is made possible through volunteers.

Volunteers are needed to teach English at ECC partner schools and to help organize donations and raise funds. Housing can be provided, and of course, a life changing experience is guaranteed!

In the future, the ECC hopes to create a volunteer program to bring people in from all over the world to get a glimpse of life in Nepal and help expose students to new cultures and the English language</p>
